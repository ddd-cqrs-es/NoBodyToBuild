NoBodyToBuild
=============

Imagine a team of *gasp* body builders that has to make a team member the new chairman. The rule is: Only members of the team can become chairman.

SampleA/B demonstrate making a member the chairman using an application service that orchestrates the collaboration of a Team object and a TeamMember object.
SampleC demonstrates the use of application and domain service, but this team putting the rule in the domain service.

The question is, regardless of this example being absurdly trivial, why would you pick one or the other from an
- encapsulation perspective
- modeling perspective
- language perspective
?
